Rodenburg © 2020–2022 Universiteit Leiden About this Course Whether you will end up working in academia or elsewhere, you will develop many transferable skills over the course of your bachelor education. The goal of this course is to help you identify your strengths and learn to communicate them to the outside world. Three topics are central to this course: Career orientation (what can you do with your education); Professional identity (what do you want to do with your education); Personal development (getting the most out of your education). As of academic year 2022–2023, the course also includes academic skills (scientific literature, presenting, writing). This part is still under construction. Sections marked with an asterisk (*) are optional. Assignment Index To pass this course, you have to hand in three assignments each year before their deadline. These assignments will be reviewed, so be careful to observe the rules set per assignment (e.g. minimum number of words). Include your full name and student number in each assignment.

Assignment 1 1.3 Further Reading (*)", " Chapter 1 Time Management In this chapter you will make your own study schedule and you will be introduced to the E-learning Skills Platform. You’ve just entered the first year of your bachelor education and are now a full-time student. Studying at university is very different from learning at school. How should you allocate your time? Can you still spend as much time on sports, hobbies, and should you join a student association? What about committees? To avoid stress from exams, deadlines and studying in general, you should consider spending at least some time on time management: How much time do you have? How should allocate your time? Does time management work? Time management is not just another buzz word, but actually has a firm basis in science. A meta analysis of 158 articles on time management showed that there is at least a moderate effect on job performance, academic achievement and well-being.1 This is more or less in line with the conclusions from an earlier systematic review on time management.2 1.1 How Much Time Do You Have? Let’s start by putting things into perspective. This is a full-time week of studying (38 hours): Figure 1.1: How a full-time week relates to the remaining hours in the week. The scientifically recommended amount of sleep for young adults is 7–9 hours per day.3 The figure shows 9 hours of sleep so as not to exaggerate the remaining time. With an average 7–9 hours of sleep and 38–40 hours of study, you have at least 65 hours a week left to spend however you see fit. You could get a part-time job, play sports, spend time on your hobbies, go to a student association, spend more time studying, etc. Time spent studying includes lectures, practicals and self-study. Here is what that looked like for a first year biology bachelor student in 2020–2021: Figure 1.2: Breakdown of the total study time in the first two blocks as a biology bachelor student at Leiden University. Data collected from the schedule of the first 17 weeks of the cohort of 2020–2021. As you can see, despite its many contact hours, a substantial part of your biology bachelor education consists of self study. This may have been inflated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but even in a normal year, you will spend a large amount of time studying by yourself. That is why you should spend some time thinking about time management: What are you going to do with all that self-study time? Is it enough for you? Can you do with less? What about time spent traveling, can you do some preparation on the train? Or listen to some music and relax for a bit? Try and make conscious decisions about how you spend your day. 1.2 How Should Allocate Your Time? A common misconception is that time management is about spending as much time as possible being productive. Instead, time management is about spending your productive hours as efficiently as possible. The faster you are done with learning, the faster you can unwind and let it all sink in. Sleep, sports, and having fun are every bit as important as the time spent studying. You should respect each of these and allocate enough time to them. The most important parts of time management is meeting deadlines and avoiding stress from deadlines. A very simple rule of thumb for achieving this is by prioritizing your tasks by urgency and importance: Figure 1.3: Variation on the Eisenhower matrix for prioritizing tasks. At some point you will be so familiar with the student life that you may not feel the need for planning your time precisely anymore. Maybe you like wrapping up some work in the evening, or maybe in the weekends. All of this is perfectly fine: Eventually you should do whatever works for you. In the first few weeks though, the key to success is to teach yourself some discipline. Write down a weekly schedule, including how you will spend self study time (reading a chapter of the book, preparing for the practicals, etc.). Not sure what to do on Monday? Start by prioritizing your tasks using figure 1.3. This helps you get a better idea of how much time you actually need, and will lower your stress. Assignment 1 You can find more information on how to effectively manage your time over at the E-learning Skills Platform. A template for a weekly schedule is included in step 2. You can use this as a starting point. Write a schedule for next week: It should include all study time (self study or otherwise); Try to include non-studying activities as well (e.g. sports, travel time, time spent at a student association); For every self-study moment in the schedule, describe in a few words how you will use that time; Look ahead at the upcoming exam. Perhaps you can read a chapter of a book, or make a summary of the lectures thus far. Submit your schedule as Excel, Word, or PDF file to Brightspace. Include your full name and student number.

How do you find reliable information? How do you even know that information is trustworthy? And once you’ve found something, how do you communicate it in such a way that others can easily find the original source? 2.1 Finding Scientific Literature There are many good databases that you can consider to find peer-reviewed scientific literature. Four popular ones are shown in table 2.1. My general advice is to access through Leiden University. This allows you to access articles from hundreds of publishers that might otherwise be behind a paywall. Table 2.1: Popular databases for finding peer-reviewed sicentific literature. Database Stengths Weaknesses Google Scholar Very easy to use. Search results not reproducible; limited to 1000 articles; includes non-peer-reviewed publications. PubMed Strong focus on clinical and biomedical literature. Mostly limited to clinical and biomedical literature. Semantic Scholar Very broad, includes all kinds of research. Has an easy search function and features to find related articles. Tries to search for what you mean (semantic). Does not allow you to search for specific combinations of words in specific parts of an article. Web of Science Very broad, includes all kinds of research. Has a very precise search function. Tries to search for what you asked (literal). Does not try to interpret what you meant to search for. Three important things to note here: There is no “winner”. These databases each have their own use. Which database you prefer, may differ depending on what you’re doing (e.g., learning about a new topic, investigating a health claim, conducting a meta-analysis). The table shown here is a simplistic summary of the findings of a comprehensive comparison by Gusenbauer &amp; Haddaway (2020).4 If literature review interests you, I highly recommend their article. Personally, I mainly use PubMed, because most research I am involved in concerns cellular, molecular, and medical biology. However, for conservation, evolution, ecology, etc., PubMed really falls short, and better alternatives would be Web of Science or Semantic Scholar. Think of Google Scholar like you would Wikipedia: It is quick and easy to use, and a great resource to get acquainted with a topic. But for actual research, Google Scholar is rarely appropriate, because it yields irreproducible search results.4–6 That is to say, you and I might find different articles using the same search terms. Personalized search results are antithetical to objective research, so use Google Scholar with caution. 2.2 Types of Scientific Literature The main types of articles are shown in the table below: Table 2.2: The four most common types of scientific literature. Type Description Use Original research article New data produced by a study and the conclusions drawn, usually with a narrow scope. Find potential explanations for a specific phenomenon; Cite the original source for an observation made. Narrative review Current understanding of a subject, usually written by an expert, usually with a broad scope. Get introduced to a new topic; Read up on the latest developments in a field. Systematic review A comprehensive review that explicitly states how studies were included, usually with a narrow scope. Get high-quality information compiled from multiple studies in a transparent, reproducible manner. Meta-analysis A systematic review with a statistical analysis of the combined results of included studies, usually with a very narrow scope. Get quantative measures of the current consensus on a subject and the extent of publication bias. Other types include pilot studies, letters to the editor and methodological studies.7 When you don’t know much about a topic yet, it is best to start with articles that have a broad scope. Narrative reviews (often simply referred to as ‘reviews’) are best suited for this purpose. Narrative reviews are subjective. They represent the findings and opinions of the author(s). Often, a narrative review will disclose little, if any information on how studies were included—a problem that makes this type of review susceptible to cherry picking.8 If you want an objective review of a certain topic, you should look for systematic reviews. These must adhere to strict quality standards to avoid cherry picking and more generally, to be reproducible.9 In principle, if you were to write a systematic review using the same database(s) and selection procedure, you should obtain the same results. The specific differences between narrative and systematic reviews are explained in more detail in Callcut &amp; Branson (2009).8 Besides cherry picking, reviews are susceptible to another kind of bias. Publication bias occurs because studies with significant results have a greater chance of publication. Hence, studies with insignificant results are underrepresented in literature, and any analysis of published literature will overestimate effects and differences. This type of bias cannot be avoided, but it can be quantified in meta-analysis,10 and even corrected for.11 If it is found to be low, the conclusions can be stated with greater confidence, and vice versa. Ideally, you would cite a high-quality meta-analysis comprised of a large number of studies, with minimal publication bias, for each claim you make. In reality, you have to make do with what’s available and adjust the confidence of your writing accordingly. Meta analyses are incredibly time-consuming and hence often limited in scope. Systematic reviews are generally slightly broader in scope but provide less concrete information on the current level of evidence. Narrative reviews are inferior in terms of evidence, but in return usually have a very broad scope. 2.3 Efficient Reading A scientific article is not a log or a lab journal. Rather than written chronologically (in the order experiments were done), articles are typically divided into sections, with strict rules on what goes where (introduction, methods, results, discussion). This is important, because it standardizes what information can be found where. However, it also means you don’t read an article from beginning to end. More realistically, literature review looks something like this: Figure 2.1: How you rougly go through an article during literature review. Questionable research practices are explained in the next section. In the most pessimistic case, where you know neither the topic, nor the methodology, you’ll be going through most of the article. But if this is your third article on pancreatic cancer, do you really need to another introduction that explains the relevance of this type of research? More articles are being published than you can ever hope to have the time to read, so I strongly suggest to use figure 2.1 as a guideline. Quickly going through an article is a skill that takes time and practice. The first couple of articles, you will constantly be looking up terms and going back and forth between sections. But by the end of your bachelor internship, you will have seen so many articles that reading one has become a fairly trivial task. Of course, there will always be easier and harder articles to read, and especially an article outside your area of expertise takes longer to understand. If an article is particularly difficult to read, that is often not a reflection of your reading skill, but rather of the quality of the writing. More on that in the next section. 2.4 Judging the Quality of an Article It can be hard to confidently state an article is of high quality, especially when you haven’t read many yet. Fortunately, identifying a poor quality article is a lot easier: Spelling errors; Low resolution figures; Flaws in analysis; Obscure or predatory journal; Questionable research practices. 1 &amp; 2 are self-explanatory. 3 requires some basic knowledge of statistics, which you will learn later on in your education. Below, I will discuss 4 and 5. Obscure journals are very easy to identify, by looking up the impact factor of the journal. In short, a lower impact factor means this journal is not cited often. That does not necessarily imply poor quality, but it does warrant more careful inspection of quality. Also be wary not to blindly trust an article simply because it is published in a high impact factor journal, like Nature (that would be an appeal to authority). Poor quality articles will occasionally slip through the cracks of the peer-reviewing process. Predatory journals deceive scientists into publication for quick financial (or other) gain.12 These often have poor, opaque quality review, meaning that they are littered with articles that would be rejected in other journals. Questionable research practices (QRP) is a collective term for practices in scientific research that are likely to result in bias, false conclusions, or difficulty to replicate the results.13 The most obvious, deliberate forms of scientific misconduct are plagiarism, fabrication and falsification, but there are many more subtle problems with how some research is conducted.14 Common QRPs are summarized in table 2.3. It is worth your while to explore the full extent of common errors (including unintentional ones) in the field of research you are conducting literature review on. Identifying one or more QRPs in a scientific article should immediately lower your trust in any conclusions drawn by the authors. Table 2.3: Common questionable research practices. QRP Description overclaiming Placing too much confidence in a finding given the sample size. overgeneralizing Generalizing the conclusions to a larger population than the one sampled from. (For example, a study on Dutch biology students in Leiden with a conclusions about ‘students’.) lack of a control group An effect is asserted without including a proper control group in the study design. inappropriate control group A comparison between groups that systematically differ in more ways than those compared (e.g., comparing young men to old women.) cherry-picking (citations) Selectively citing literature in agreement with the authors’ views or hypotheses. cherry-picking (data) Omitting data not in agreement with the hypothesis, or the rest of the data. Deleting outliers. cherry-picking (results) Only mentioning significant results in the conclusion or abstract, without mentioning negative findings. HARKing Basing the ‘hypothesis’ in the introduction on the results found in the data. (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known.) p-hacking A variety of practices aimed at changing the analysis, the data, or the data collection, until a significant result is found. Often occurs unintentionally. Occasionally, articles are written specifically to help the reader learn to judge the quality of articles.15 You can always try and search for these. 2.5 Citing Literature When you cite literature, you have to cite the original source. That means that if you want to cite something you read in a review, you have to look up the article that the review used for this claim. The exception to this rule is when you want to cite the overarching conclusions made by the review itself—in this case you cite the review. 2.5.1 Reasons for Citing Important reasons for citing include: To provide evidence for a claim; To refer the reader to further details; To give proper attribution to the work of others. The first two reasons are self-evident, but the third is just as important. Quoting, or even paraphrasing other literature without referring to it, is a form of plagiarism. This includes articles of poor quality, and even unpublished work. If you used it, you have to cite it. Citations are not needed for: Original ideas; Claims that are easily observable; Claims that are considered common knowledge within your field. For example: This page may help students learn to cite,\\(^\\text{no reference here}\\) most people use smartphones on a daily basis,\\(^\\text{nor here}\\) and smoking causes cancer.\\(^\\text{nor here}\\) 2.5.2 Citation Style When you publish an article to a journal, you must adhere to the citation style of that journal. If you are not publishing to a scientific journal, you can use whatever style you like. For example, this page is using the style of the journal Nature. Instead of learning a specific style, I recommend learning how to automatically generate citations with a reference manager. This will also save you the arduous process of manually writing and formatting all your references. Some options are: Use a reference manager with a free version, like Zotero or Mendeley; Use a paid reference manager, for which you have a discount at Leiden University, like EndNote; Keep your own list of references (see below). For documents written in RStudio, like analyses, or even this website, you can manage your references within RStudio without additional software. If you’re interested, I explain this in the video below: Assignment 2 Choose a topic within biology of your liking; Find at least one article you think is of poor quality; Find at least one article you think is of good quality; Explain why you think these articles are good or not (min. 400 words); Add a reference section under your assignment where you refer to both articles in the style of a journal of your choosing. You are of course allowed to use a reference manager. Upload your assignment to Brightspace as a Word or PDF file. Include your full name and student number. Deadline: 3 December References 4.

Assignment 3", " Chapter 3 Personality Test Identify your strength and weaknesses, and decide what you want to improve upon. In the meeting today, you conducted a (brief) personality test. If you want a more comprehensive version, or you missed today’s meeting, try this one. My MBTI Type is X, Now What? First, note that this is nothing more than a quick and free way to explore your own preferences. Meyers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is not a valid scientific tool to assess personality traits,16 so take the results with a grain of salt. Second, a test might indicate that you are an introvert or extravert, but this is hardly interesting information for your employer or internship supervisor. Instead, you can use this information to decide what areas you want to improve on. For example, a strongly introverted individual may need more practice working effectively in groups, while a strongly extraverted person may have more difficulty working independently. Both are skills mentioned in many job applications. You are still at a very early point in your (academic) career. If you fear public speaking, then grab every chance to present during courses. Now is the time to make a fool out of yourself, not when you land your first job. If you consistently score poorly on written assignments, then consider investing more time in reading scientific articles, and try to apply what you’ve learned to your own writing. The goal of this assignment is not to categorize students into archetypes. Instead, it is about awareness of what you are like now, and what you would like to be like later. Everything you start improving today will make you a more appealing candidate to a potential employer or supervisor. This in turn increases your chances of landing the job of your liking, or getting the internship you really want. Assignment 3 What was the outcome of the test? Do you agree with it? If not, which type do you think suits you best? Below is a list of strengths and weaknesses in no particular order. Pick at least 3 (or come up with your own) which you feel are your strengths, and 3 which are your weaknesses and explain why you think so. End your assignment with a (brief) plan for what you want to improve: Do you want to capitalize on certain strengths? Do you want to improve your weaknesses? Are these skills relevant for your future career? Explain why you want to address these skills specifically and how you intend to improve them.

Applying for an internship will also look much more professional if you include one. 4.1 Content A curriculum vitae (CV), or resume, must contain the following information: Contact information (full name, address, email address, phone number); Formal education + degrees obtained (including high school); Work experience (including part-time work). I also recommend adding the following, if applicable: Voluntary work experience (e.g. voluntary internship or substantial committee work); Personal profile (dedicate a small section of your CV to describe yourself); Language proficiency (including relevant tests if taken); Computer skills (e.g. Microsoft Office, Photoshop, statistical software); Certificates (e.g. language course, masterclass); Interests (e.g. sports, hobbies); Other (any relevant experience not listed above). 4.2 Structure A few rules will make it easier for recruiters and other addressees to see in one quick glance who you are and what relevant experience you have: Write experiences anti-chronologically (most recent experience first); Show the most relevant experiences to what you’re applying for first; (To do this while maintaining anti-chronological order, simply rearrange the headers for education, work, voluntary work and/or internships.) Your personal profile should be on the first page. Every year there are questions about the personal profile. Take it from a recruiter with 7 years of experience (Dr. Huijskens): A few sentences describing yourself are helpful and can discern you from the many other applicants. It doesn’t look silly, or unprofessional. If you missed the meeting, or want a quick recap of what a personal profile looks like, please watch the videos on Brightspace. There are also plenty of templates you can find online, or you can use mine as an example. When using templates, keep in mind what the intended audience is: Colorfully decorated templates can come across as unprofessional to some, while matter-of-fact, black-and-white templates may come across as boring to others. For an internship in science communication, the former may be appropriate, whereas a job in medical biology might favor the latter. Assignment 4 There will be a meeting on how to make a good looking CV organized by Dr. Ilse Huijskens of the Science Career Service. Based on this meeting, create your CV and personal profile. Did you obtain your propedeuse? Then include that under “Education”. This is a relevant degree and it shows your commitment to completing the program. If you think you don’t have a lot to write down, then dedicate more space to your interests, your personal profile and what you intend to do (e.g., a minor you want to enroll for).1 For example, if I see a student is interested in statistics/machine learning/data science, then I may consider them for an internship, even if they do not have the relevant experience yet. Also, let this be a wake-up call: Of course, you are only a second year student with at best a propedeuse degree. But you could apply for a job as a student assistant, work an administrative job at a pharmaceutical company, apply as a volunteer, join a student committee, take a language course, etc. You have to find ways to distinguish yourself from the 100+ other second year biology students at Leiden University. Upload your resume with personal profile to Brightspace as a Word or PDF file. Include your full name and student number. Deadline: 3 December If you include experience on your CV you do not have yet, be very clear about the fact that this is e.g. “planned”, or “expected”.↩︎ "],["motivation-letter.html", "Chapter 5 Motivation Letter 5.1 Professionalism 5.2 Content 5.3 Structure Assignment 5", " Chapter 5 Motivation Letter A good motivation letter explains why you should be considered for a certain position. It conveys your directly relevant qualities and your interest in the position. When you apply somewhere, you usually send a motivation letter and a resume. The resume is just an attachment that lists your qualifications, education and work experience. Your motivation letter is how you try to convince the reader to consider a follow-up conversation with you. Whether you are going to pursue a career in academics or not, almost everywhere you apply, you will include a motivation letter. Even if it is not explicitly asked for, your first email to a potential employer should essentially be a motivation letter. 5.1 Professionalism Address a specific person, not a group. You may not know who to address your motivation letter to, but that is unfortunately how it works. You’ll just have to research it. If you send your letter to a group or institute, chances are it will be sent to HR, where your chances are almost zero compared to sending your letter to someone specific. Use a proper opening. You may be used to addressing people informally, but when you contact someone for an internship or job opportunity, it is better to err on the side of formality. If your email is addressed to an institute, rather than a specific person, write “Dear [Institute Name]”. Motivation letters that say “Dear reader, …” or even worse, just “Dear, …” do not look like they were written for this specific position. Be polite. You may have had a long, unfruitful experience searching for a job or internship so far, but you are still asking someone a favor. Any frustration you might have should not show in a motivation letter. Avoid spelling/grammar errors. Always let someone proofread. If you know you are dyslexic, take extra care to have one or several people proofread; Don’t know someone’s title? Look it up. Some care more about their title than others, but when in doubt, address people with title (e.g. Dr., Prof.). For academics, you can usually look up how their names are listed on their institute site. Use proper closing lines. For instance: “Thank you for your consideration.” These may seem obvious, but still every year, we get emails from students (including requests for internships) that look like they were addressed to a friend, start literally with “Dear Sir/Madam,” or are otherwise unconvincing. You only get one chance at a first impression! 5.2 Content After reading only your motivation letter, 3 things should be clear to the reader: Who are you (and what is your current role at Leiden University); Why do you apply for this specific position (how does it align with your interests); Why should you be considered (what is your relevant experience)? Lastly, keep in mind that it is a motivation letter. Convey your enthusiasm! 5.3 Structure While there are no strict rules about what constitutes a great motivation letter, here are some guidelines: Use first paragraph to introduce yourself. Briefly explain your affinities and your interests. Try to keep the first paragraph short, so the reader can quickly move on to your question; Use the second paragraph to explain why you are interested in this position in particular. Do not use general terms here, but try to explain what specifically aligns with your interests (see the example below). If this is a motivation letter for an internship, read some papers by the person or group you want to join to get a good idea of what to write here; Use the third paragraph to quickly summarize practical information. How many EC/hours should the project be? When can you start? When is it due? Can you stay longer? If you haven’t already, I also recommend to mention that you would like to elaborate in a follow-up conversation; Use an informative title as the subject (e.g. BSc internship application March–July 2022); Include a resume (CV). Example of explaining how your interests align: Good: During my studies, I was particularly interested in the ecology of soil organisms. I really enjoy trying to understand how different species compete for nutrients. When I looked at your profile page on the university website, I saw that your research group studies the soil microbiome, which is exactly what peaks my interest; Poor: I lean more towards macrobiology over microbiology and I would like to do something with evolutionary research. Poor: I read your paper on microbiome sequencing and thought it was interesting. (The first example is specific, and conveys how your interests align with their research. The second example is too broad, and the third example only contains their research, but not why it interests you.) Assignment 5 In this assignment you are going to write a motivation letter for a (hypothetical) Bachelor internship position. Of course, if you already have an idea of a research group you would like to do your internship at, then by all means, use that research group as the fictive recipient! We will try our best to provide you with feedback after the deadline. You and over a hundred biology students at Leiden University are following the same education. Why should you be considered for an internship position, why are you interested in this position, and what do you know of the group you are applying to? These are elements that should be present in your motivation letter. You may think that this assignment is quite early, but keep in mind that if you want to do an internship abroad, you have until 1 December (outside Europe) or 1 February (within Europe) to apply, and you will most likely also require a motivation letter. Furthermore, having written one motivation letter will make it much easier to adapt it for another opportunity. Choose a research institute, group, or professor you would potentially be interested in doing research with (starting points: commonly chosen institutes, research themes at the IBL, scientists at the IBL).

Your network is simply the people you are in contact with. If you already know people in a field you want to work in, or do an internship, it is so much easier to land a position. Whether you actively engage in networking or not, everyone has a network. The purpose of today’s lecture by Ilse Huijskens from the Science Career Service is to make you aware of your network, and help you expand it.

If you can comfortably run simple analyses and write scripts, you have a strong advantage over other candidates. Just before your internship you will have a course called General Research Skills (GRS). In this course, you will be prepared for your internship by teaching you how to effectively search literature, keep your lab journal, and for the largest part: Statistics. Many students find statistics to be a difficult subject. After all, within one course you have to brush up your programming skills, basic mathematics and learn the actual statistics. We have therefore decided to offer students a self-test of their R programming skill. To pass this assignment, all you have to do is do the test and submit it. It does not matter how many questions you answer correctly. However, to accommodate students that find programming difficult, we offer a one-week crash course in R, the week before GRS (for 2022–2023 students, the crash course starts January 30). Assignment 7 Download the test here; Open the test in Adobe Reader, or another program that supports fillable PDFs; Try answering first without the use of R, or internet; Then, you may use R to see if you can figure out the exercises you weren’t able to answer; Save your changes to the PDF and submit the result to Brightspace. Finished the test? The answers will be made available after the meeting, so you can check how many questions you answered correctly. The implications are shown in the table below: Table 7.1: How to interpret the outcome of the self-test. Correct answers Interpretation &lt;50% Don’t worry, we will start GRS all the way from the beginning, but consider joining the R Crash Course to reduce your study load during GRS. 50–75% Your R skills need some brushing up, but you will probably be able to keep up with the pace of the course just fine. You are still welcome to join if you want a refresher. 75%&gt; You are more than good enough at R for GRS. Upload your filled in PDF to Brightspace.

Assignment 8 For this assignment, you pick a researcher in a field of your liking and interview them about their studies, work experience and everything that contributes to their current employment. To pass this assignment, you: Record the interview. (Make sure to ask for permission to the interviewee.) Ask all obligatory questions and at least two optional questions. If you don’t like the optional questions you have to think of two questions yourself. Write at least 400 words about the answers. Hand in the assignment on Brightspace before the deadline (1 April). Disclaimer: Some people are more open than others, so please try to read the room and make sure that your interviewee stays comfortable answering your questions. If your interviewee refuses to answer a question, that is okay. Ask them if they are willing to answer a different question. Obligatory questions Who are you and what is your current job? What did you study? (Also ask about their specialization/research projects.) Did you choose to do a PhD? If yes/no, why? Did you know what kind of work you wanted to do while studying? Do you have any tips for students who are currently pursuing a career in biology? Optional questions Did you go abroad during your (study) career? Is your job suitable to combine with volunteer work/your family/a time-consuming hobby? Are you considering changing jobs anywhere soon and why? What is the workload of your job? Would you have done anything differently during your study? (e.g., different courses, a different specialization, going abroad) Did it take you a long time to find a job after graduating? What achievement during your studies and/or career are you most proud of? Do not forget to include your full name and student number. Deadline: 16 April 23:59 FAQ Who am I allowed to interview? Your interviewee can be anyone directly involved in your internship, except for fellow students (BSc or MSc). PhD-students, technicians, postdocs and professors are all allowed. If you do your internship in a non-academic environment and you have someone in mind, make sure to choose someone who has at least 2 years of work experience. My interviewee does not want to answer a question. What should I do? Either pick a different question from the list, or make up a question yourself. If the interviewee answers the question but asks you to keep it confidential, you can summarize it into a general sentence (e.g.: “Due to personal circumstances the interviewee could not finish their studies.”) or skip the question as a whole. If they do not want to answer an obligatory question, don’t forget to state that in your assignment. My interviewee gives very short answers. How do I get to 400 words? Try to ask follow up questions. For example, if you ask whether they liked doing a PhD and they only answer yes, ask them what aspects of their PhD made it worthwhile, or if they obtained a goal they are very proud of. You can also expand by including your own opinions about their answers, whether you can relate to them, etc. "],["reflection.html", "Chapter 9 Reflection Assignment 9", " Chapter 9 Reflection If you have made it this far then that means you are close to obtaining a bachelor of science in biology. What are your plans for the coming years? Assignment 9 In an age of climate change, pandemic, population ageing, sustainability challenges, health care crises and science denial, society desperately needs your talents as a biologist. For at least three years, you have learned to design, perform and analyze experiments. You have learned to communicate findings verbally and in writing. You have learned where to find scientific articles, and—if you are in the midst of your internship—by now you have likely read more of them then anyone without scientific education. What will you do after obtaining your bachelor degree? Will you continue with a master’s degree? Have your decided which? How have your interests developed over the course of your education? Do you aspire different goals than before? Write in at least 400 words how you reflect on your bachelor education and what your plans are for the near future. You may use your previous assignment “Where do you see yourself in 5–10 years” as a starting point. Do you still have the same plans?

Substitute Assignment 10.5 Changing Programs (*)", " Chapter 10 What Can You Do with a BSc Biology? Skills developed in this chapter: Career orientation, professional identity You have chosen a to pursue a bachelor degree in biology. What are the options after your education? Should you pursue a master degree? Which one? When should you start thinking about this? These are questions are addressed in this chapter. 10.1 When Should I Choose What? For a quick overview, have a look at this flowchart (PDF). A bachelor of science is also your entrance ticket to a master program. In The Netherlands, a large majority of students that obtain a bachelor degree go on to pursue a master degree. According to the national student survey, 91% of former biology students at Leiden University went on to pursue a master degree. Deadlines in the 1st year: If you want to join the honours college, the deadline is in early February (always check the university site). Deadlines in the 2nd year: You must choose your specialization before the second semester (there will be a meeting on this subject); Minors without a selection procedure must be enrolled in by 31 May (TU Delft, Erasmus, LDE), or 15 July (Leiden University); Minors with a selection procedure (TU Delft, Erasmus, LDE, Leiden) must be enrolled in by 15 April; If you want to study abroad during your bachelor, you can do so in the third year (minor and/or internship). The deadline to apply is 1 December (outside of Europe) and 1 February (within Europe). This involves a lot of paperwork and there are additional criteria, including grades and EC obtained, so contact your study advisor early. There is usually a Study Abroad Festival in early October where you can orient. Deadlines in the 3rd year: An internship agreement must be signed before the start of the internship, which will be in late February (refer to the BSc Research Project Booklet). 10.2 What Is a Minor? In the third year of your bachelor education, the first half (30 ECTS) is spent on a minor education. You can use this to learn more about a specific topic in biology, or to broaden your knowledge by choosing a minor from a different institute. The list of minor educations you can choose from is large. As of writing, there are 56 minors offered by Leiden University, and it is also possible to follow a minor at TU Delft or the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. By the time you have to choose a minor, you will be informed of which are eligible for your bachelor education. However, minors from other institutes may have additional entry requirements and earlier deadlines for application. The minor explanation at the IBL may already be too late for minors at different institutes, so orient early. Also be sure the check whether a minor is full-time or not. If you want to do a minor, but it is less than 30 ECTS, consult with your study advisor about the possibility of filling the remaining time with other courses. If you have trouble choosing, then keep in mind that on the long run, your choice of minor will have little influence on your career. Nonetheless, a minor is a great opportunity to specialize in a specific area, or to learn about a different field. 10.3 Where Can I Do an Internship? In the third year of your education, after you complete your minor, you will do a research internship. Through your internship, you can find out what it is really like to work as a scientist, and it allows you to get to know a particular field well. Without additional approval, you can do your internship at any research group of: Institute Biology Leiden (IBL); Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML); Naturalis Biodiversity Center. With permission from the Board of Examiners, you can also do an internship at: Leiden Institute of Chemistry (LIC); Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR); Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). It is technically also possible to do you internship somewhere completely different, even at a company. However, you will have to consult with your study advisor for this. So how do you find an interesting internship? Essentially by networking. The moment you enter the university, your networking has begun. Every person you come into contact with is an opportunity for you to get to know their work or research. Never hesitate to ask your professor or any of the assistants about their research—they are probably happy to talk about it. This also means you should exercise a certain level of professionalism the first time you contact someone. You never know what you might need from them in the future. Also always by on the lookout for internship markets/events or even LinkedIn posts. There are plenty of research groups looking for an intern. 10.4 Which Masters Can I Do? To choose your master, always try to join the master’s day/week. At this event, all master educations can provide you with information on their contents and admission requirements. It is never too soon to orient, so try to join whenever you can. Note that there are also master events outside Leiden. You will be notified of those when they take place. The IBL offers several master programs to students with a bachelor degree in biology. These include: From Cells To Organisms Evolutionary Biology Molecular Genetics &amp; Biotechnology Biodiversity and Sustainability Biology and Education Biology and Science Communication and Society Biology and Business Studies Although it well be extra challenging due to differences in bachelor courses, you can also follow a master program from other institutes, some examples include: Biomedical Sciences; Biopharmaceutical Science; Life Science &amp; Technology; Statistics &amp; Data Science; Masters from the Institute of Environmental Sciences; Masters from other universities. Substitute Assignment Contemplate where you see yourself 5–10 years from now (Dutch or English). You can use the following questions as reference (but you don’t have to): Why did you choose this education? What do you expect from this education? Are there any subjects you are good at, or enjoy learning about? Do you have any plans for a specialization, minor, internship, or master education yet? Why does this interest you? Do you currently lean more towards a career in academia, government, business, or something else entirely (e.g. your own company, an NGO)? Do you have any plans for studying or working abroad? Have you looked into the available programs? How do you currently balance work and life? How do you feel about that? Upload your assignment to Brightspace as a Word or PDF file (there is a dedicated submission link for the substitute assignment). Include your full name and student number. The minimum number of words is shown in the table below. Deadline: 1 June. Table 10.1: Required minimum number of words by year and number of missed components (meetings, deadlines, assignments).

Note: Retaking the course through the substitute assignment is only possible until 1 June. No new assignments are accepted between 2 June and 1 November. Exceptions count as an ‘extra resit’ and can only be made with permission from the board of examiners. 10.5 Changing Programs (*) Switching bachelor programs is a big decision. You should always discuss this with the student coordinator.2 Nevertheless, here are some things to consider: Successfully completing your first year (propedeuse) is something to put on your CV, so you may want to consider switching after that; Obtaining a bachelor of science opens many doors. You may not have to switch at all to do the internship or master you are interested in; Skills learned in one education transfer well to another, and occasionally you can even get exemption from courses that are similar to what you followed.
