Assignment 1 1.3 Further Reading (*)", " Chapter 1 Time Management In this chapter you will make your own study schedule and you will be introduced to the E-learning Skills Platform. Youve just entered the first year of your bachelor education and are now a full-time student. How should you allocate your time? Can you still spend as much time on sports, hobbies, and should you join a student association? What about committees? To avoid stress from exams, deadlines and studying in general, you should consider spending at least some time on time management: How much time do you have? How should allocate your time? Does time management work? Time management is not just another buzz word, but actually has a firm basis in science. A meta analysis of 158 articles on time management showed that there is at least a moderate effect on job performance, academic achievement and well-being.1 This is more or less in line with the conclusions from an earlier systematic review on time management.2 1.1 How Much Time Do You Have? Lets start by putting things into perspective. This is a full-time week of studying (38 hours): Figure 1.1: How a full-time week related to the remaining hours in the week. The scientifically recommended amount of sleep for young adults is 79 hours per day.3 The figure shows 9 hours of sleep so as not to exaggerate the remaining time. With an average 79 hours of sleep and 3840 hours of study, you have at least 65 hours a week left to spend however you see fit. You could get a part-time job, play sports, spend time on your hobbies, go to a student association, spend more time studying, etc. Time spent studying includes lectures, practicals and self-study. Here is what that looked like for a first year biology bachelor student in 20202021: Figure 1.2: Breakdown of the total study time in the first two blocks as a biology bachelor student at Leiden University. Data collected from the schedule of the first 17 weeks of the cohort of 20202021. As you can see, despite its many contact hours, a substantial part of your biology bachelor education consists of self study. This may have been inflated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but even in a normal year, you will spend a large amount of time studying by yourself. That is why you should spend some time thinking about time management: What are you going to do with all that self-study time? Is it enough for you? Can you do with less? What about time spent traveling, can you do some preparation on the train? Or listen to some music and relax for a bit? Try and make conscious decisions about how you spend your day. 1.2 How Should Allocate Your Time? A common misconception is that time management is about spending as much time as possible being productive. Instead, time management is about spending your productive hours as efficiently as possible. The faster you are done with learning, the faster you can unwind and let it all sink in. Sleep, sports, and having fun are every bit as important as the time spent studying. You should respect each of these and allocate enough time to them. The most important parts of time management is meeting deadlines and avoiding stress from deadlines. A very simple rule of thumb for achieving this is by prioritizing your tasks by urgency and importance: Figure 1.3: Variation on the Eisenhower matrix for prioritizing tasks. At some point you will be so familiar with the student life that you may not feel the need for planning your time precisely anymore. Maybe you like wrapping up some work in the evening, or maybe in the weekends. All of this is perfectly fine: Eventually you should do whatever works for you. In the first few weeks though, the key to success is to teach yourself some discipline. Write down a weekly schedule, including how you will spend self study time (reading a chapter of the book, preparing for the practicals, etc.). Not sure what to do on Monday? Start by prioritizing your tasks using figure 1.3. This helps you get a better idea of how much time you actually need, and will lower your stress. Assignment 1 You can find more information on how to effectively manage your time over at the E-learning Skills Platform. A template for a weekly schedule is included in step 2. You can use this as a starting point. Write a schedule for next week: It should include all study time (self study or otherwise); Try to include non-studying activities as well (e.g. sports, travel time, time spent at a student association); For every self-study moment in the schedule, describe in a few words how you will use that time; Look ahead at the upcoming exam. Perhaps you can read a chapter of a book, or make a summary of the lectures thus far. Submit your schedule as Excel, Word, or PDF file to Brightspace. Include your full name and student number.

Assignment 2 2.5 Changing Programs (*)", " Chapter 2 What Can You Do with a BSc Biology? Skills developed in this chapter: Career orientation, professional identity You have chosen a to pursue a bachelor degree in biology. What are the direct options after your education? Should you pursue a master degree? Which one? When should you start thinking about this? These are questions I imagine many of you have. 2.1 When Should I Choose What? For a quick overview, have a look at this flowchart (PDF). A bachelor of science is also your entrance ticket to a master program. In The Netherlands, a large majority of students that obtain a bachelor degree go on to pursue a master degree. According to the national student survey, 91% of former biology students at Leiden University went on to pursue a master degree. Deadlines in the 1st year: If you want to join the honours college, the deadline is in early February (always check the university site). Deadlines in the 2nd year: You must choose your specialization before the second semester (there will be a meeting on this subject); Minors without a selection procedure must be enrolled in by 31 May (TU Delft, Erasmus, LDE), or 15 July (Leiden University); Minors with a selection procedure (TU Delft, Erasmus, LDE, Leiden) must be enrolled in by 15 April; If you want to study abroad during your bachelor, you can do so in the third year (minor and/or internship). The deadline to apply is 1 December (outside of Europe) and 1 February (within Europe). This involves a lot of paperwork and there are additional criteria, including grades and EC obtained, so contact your study advisor early. There is usually a Study Abroad Festival in early October where you can orient. Deadlines in the 3rd year: An internship agreement must be signed before the start of the internship, which will be in late February (refer to the BSc Research Project Booklet). 2.2 What Is a Minor? In the third year of your bachelor education, the first half (30 ECTS) is spent on a minor education. You can use this to learn more about a specific topic in biology, or to broaden your knowledge by choosing a minor from a different institute. The list of minor educations you can choose from is large. As of writing, there are 56 minors offered by Leiden University, and it is also possible to follow a minor at TU Delft or the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. By the time you have to choose a minor, you will be informed of which are eligible for your bachelor education. However, minors from other institutes may have additional entry requirements and earlier deadlines for application. The minor explanation at the IBL may already be too late for minors at different institutes, so orient early. Also be sure the check whether a minor is full-time or not. If you want to do a minor, but it is less than 30 ECTS, consult with your study advisor about the possibility of filling the remaining time with other courses. If you have trouble choosing, then keep in mind that on the long run, your choice of minor will have little influence on your career. Nonetheless, a minor is a great opportunity to specialize in a specific area, or to learn about a different field. 2.3 Where Can I Do an Internship? In the third year of your education, after you complete your minor, you will do a research internship. Through your internship, you can find out what it is really like to work as a scientist, and it allows you to get to know a particular field well. Without additional approval, you can do your internship at any research group of: Institute Biology Leiden (IBL); Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML); Naturalis Biodiversity Center. With permission from the Board of Examiners, you can also do an internship at: Leiden Institute of Chemistry (LIC); Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR); Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). It is technically also possible to do you internship somewhere completely different, even at a company. However, you will have to consult with your study advisor for this. So how do you find an interesting internship? Essentially by networking. The moment you enter the university, your networking has begun. Every person you come into contact with is an opportunity for you to get to know their work or research. Never hesitate to ask your professor or any of the assistants about their researchthey are probably happy to talk about it. This also means you should exercise a certain level of professionalism the first time you contact someone. You never know what you might need from them in the future. Also always by on the lookout for internship markets/events or even LinkedIn posts. There are plenty of research groups looking for an intern. 2.4 Which Masters Can I Do? To choose your master, always try to join the masters day/week. At this event, all master educations can provide you with information on their contents and admission requirements. It is never too soon to orient, so try to join whenever you can. Note that there are also master events outside Leiden. You will be notified of those when they take place. The IBL offers several master programs to students with a bachelor degree in biology. These include: From Cells To Organisms Evolutionary Biology Molecular Genetics &amp; Biotechnology Biodiversity and Sustainability Biology and Education Biology and Science Communication and Society Biology and Business Studies Although it well be extra challenging due to differences in bachelor courses, you can also follow a master program from other institutes, some examples include: Biomedical Sciences; Biopharmaceutical Science; Life Science &amp; Technology; Statistics &amp; Data Science; Masters from the Institute of Environmental Sciences; Masters from other universities. Assignment 2 Write in at least 400 words where you see yourself 510 years from now (Dutch or English). You can use the following questions as reference (but you dont have to): Why did you choose this education? Are there any subjects you are good at, or enjoy learning about? Do you have any plans for a specialization, minor, or perhaps even master education yet? Why does this interest you? If you had to choose now, where would you like to do an internship and why? Do you currently lean more towards a career in academia, a governmental organization, business, or something else entirely (e.g. your own company, an NGO)? Do you have any plans for studying abroad? Have you looked into the available programs? How do you currently balance work and life? How do you feel about that? Upload your assignment to Brightspace as a Word or PDF file. Include your full name and student number. Deadline: 3 December 2.5 Changing Programs (*) Switching to another bachelor program is a big decision. You should always discuss this with the student coordinator.1 With that said, here are somethings to consider: Successfully completing your first year gets you a certificate (propedeuse), so you may want to consider switching after that; Obtaining a bachelor of science degree opens many doors. You may not have to switch at all; Skills learned in one education may transfer well to another, and occasionally you can even get exemption from certain courses that are similar to what you followed.

Assignment 3", " Chapter 3 Personality Test Identify your strength and weaknesses, and decide what you want to improve upon. In the meeting today, you conducted a (brief) personality test. If you want a more comprehensive version, or you missed todays meeting, try this one. My MBTI Type is X, Now What? A test might indicate that you are an introvert or extravert, but this is hardly interesting information for your employer. Instead, you can use this information to your own advantage. For example, a strongly introverted individual may need more practice working effectively in groups, while a strongly extraverted person may have more difficulty working independently. You are still at a very early point in your academic career. If you fear public speaking, then grab every chance to present during courses. If you consistently score poorly on written assignments, then consider investing more time in reading scientific articles, or writing down your experimental results and their implications. The goal of this assignment is not to categorize students into archetypes. Instead, it is about awareness of what you are like now, and what you would like to improve, such that you can become a more appealing candidate to a potential employer. Assignment 3 What was the outcome of the test? Do you agree with it? If not, which type do you think suits you best? Below is a list of strengths and weaknesses in no particular order. Pick at least 3 (or come up with your own) which you feel are your strengths, and 3 which are your weaknesses and explain why you think so. End your assignment with a (brief) plan for what you want to improve: Do you want to capitalize on certain strengths? Do you want to improve your weaknesses? Are these skills relevant for your future career? Explain why you want to address these skills specifically and how you intend to improve them.

Applying for an internship will also look much more professional if you include one. 4.1 Content A curriculum vitae (CV) or resume must contain the following information: Contact information (full name, address, email address, phone number); Formal education + degrees obtained (including high school); Work experience (including part-time work). I also recommend adding the following, if applicable: Voluntary work experience (e.g. voluntary internship or substantial committee work); Personal profile (dedicate a small section of your CV to describe yourself); Language proficiency (including relevant tests if taken); Computer skills (e.g. Microsoft Office, Photoshop, statistical software); Certificates (e.g. language course, masterclass); Interests (e.g. sports, hobbies); Other (any relevant experience not listed above). There are plenty of templates you can find online. You can also use mine as an example. Assignment 4 There will be a meeting on how to make a good looking CV organized by Ilse Huijskens of the Science Career Service. Based on this meeting, create your CV and personal profile and upload both to Brightspace. Did you obtain your propedeuse yet? Then include that under Education. This is a relevant degree and it shows your commitment to completing the program. If you think you dont have a lot to write down, then dedicate more space to your interests, your personal profile and what you intend to do (e.g. a minor you want to enroll for).2 For example, if I see a student is interested in statistics / machine learning / data science, then I may consider them for an internship, even if they do not have the relevant experience yet. Also, let this be a wake-up call: Of course, you are only a second year student with at best a propedeuse degree. But you could apply for a job as a student assistant, work an administrative job at a pharmaceutical company, apply as a volunteer, join a student committee, take a language course, etc. You have to find ways to distinguish yourself from the 100-something other second year biology students at Leiden University. Upload your assignment to Brightspace as a Word or PDF file. Include your full name and student number. Deadline: 3 December If you include experience on your CV you do not have yet, be very clear about the fact that this is e.g. planned, or expected. "],["writing-a-motivation-letter.html", "Chapter 5 Writing a Motivation Letter 5.1 Professionalism 5.2 Content 5.3 Structure Assignment 5", " Chapter 5 Writing a Motivation Letter A good motivation letter explains why you should be considered for a certain position. It conveys your directly relevant qualities and your interest in the position. When you apply somewhere, you usually send a motivation letter and a resume. The resume is just an attachment that lists your qualifications, education and work experience. Your motivation letter is how you try to convince the reader to consider a follow-up conversation with you. Whether you are going to pursue a career in academics or not, almost everywhere you apply, you will include a motivation letter. Even if it is not explicitly asked for, your first email to a potential employer should essentially be a motivation letter. 5.1 Professionalism Use a proper opening. You may be used to addressing people informally, but when you contact someone for an internship or job opportunity, it is better to err on the side of formality. If your email is addressed to an institute, rather than a specific person, write Dear [Institute Name]. Motivation letters that say Dear reader,  or even worse, just Dear,  do not look like they were written for this specific position. Be polite. You may have had a long, unfruitful experience searching for a job or internship so far, but you are still asking someone a favor. Any frustration you might have should not show in a motivation letter. Avoid spelling/grammar errors. Always let someone proofread; Dont know someones title? Look it up. Some care more about their title than others, but when in doubt, address people with title (e.g. Dr., Prof.). For academics, you can usually look up how their names are listed on their institute site. Use proper closing lines. For instance: Thank you for your consideration. These may seem obvious, but still every year, we get emails with questions from students (including requests for internships) that look like they were addressed to a friend, read like a rant, or are otherwise unconvincing. You only get one chance at a first impression! 5.2 Content After reading only your motivation letter, 3 things should be clear to the reader: Who are you (and what is your current role at Leiden University); Why do you apply for this specific position (how does it align with your interests); Why should you be considered (what is your relevant experience)? Lastly, keep in mind that it is a motivation letter. Convey your enthusiasm! 5.3 Structure While there are no strict rules about what constitutes a great motivation letter, here are some guidelines that you can follow: Use first paragraph to introduce yourself. Briefly explain your affinities and your interests. Try to keep the first paragraph short, so the reader can quickly move onto your question; Use the second paragraph to explain why you are interested in this position in particular. Do not use general terms here, but try to explain what specifically aligns with your interests (see the example below). If this is a motivation letter for an internship, read some papers by the person or group you want to join to get a good idea of what to write here; Use the third paragraph to quickly summarize practical information. How many EC/hours should the project be? When can you start? When is it due? Can you stay longer? If you havent already, I also recommend to mention that you would like to elaborate in a follow-up conversation; Use an informative title as the subject (e.g. BSc internship application MarchJuly 2022); Include a resume (CV). Example of explaining how your interests align with the researcher you are approaching: Good: During my studies, I was particularly interested in the ecology of soil organisms. I really enjoy trying to understand how different species compete for nutrients. When I looked at your profile page on the university website, I saw that your research group studies the soil microbiome, which is exactly what peaks my interest; Poor: I lean more towards macrobiology over microbiology and I would like to do something with evolutionary research. Poor: I read your paper on microbiome sequencing and thought it was interesting. (The first example is specific, and conveys how your interests align with their research. The second example is too broad, and the third example only contains their research, but not why it interests you.) Assignment 5 In this assignment you are going to write a motivation letter for a (hypothetical) Bachelor internship position. Of course, if you already have an idea of a research group you would like to do your internship at, then by all means, use that research group as the fictive recipient! We will try our best to provide you with feedback after the deadline. You and over a hundred biology students at Leiden University are following the same education. Why should you be considered for an internship position, why are you interested in this position, and what do you know of the group you are applying to? These are elements that should be present in your motivation letter. You may think that this assignment is quite early, but keep in mind that if you want to do an internship abroad, you have until 1 December (outside Europe) or 1 February (within Europe) to apply, and you will most likely also require a motivation letter. Furthermore, having written one motivation letter will make it much easier to adapt it for another opportunity. Choose a research institute, group, or professor you would potentially be interested in doing research with (starting points: commonly chosen institutes, research themes at the IBL, scientists at the IBL). You may choose any scientist or research group you can find online, which you find interesting; Write a motivation letter according to the guidelines shown here. There is no minimum number of words, as long as every aspect is clearly mentioned. Upload your motivation letter to Brightspace. Do not forget your full name and student number.

If you can comfortably run simple analyses and write scripts, you have a strong advantage over other candidates. Just before your internship you will have a course called General Research Skills. In this course, you will be prepared for your internship by teaching you how to effectively search literature, keep your lab journal, and for the largest part: Statistics. Many students find statistics to be a difficult subject. After all, within one course you have to brush up your programming skills, basic mathematics and learn the actual statistics. We have therefore decided to offer students a self-test of their R programming skill. To pass this assignment, all you have to do is do the test and submit it. It does not matter if you pass or not. However, to accomodate students that find programming difficult, we offer a one-week crash course in R, the week before General Research Skills (for 20212022 students, the crash course starts on 24 January). You can find the course here. Assignment 7 Download the test here; Open the test in Adobe Reader; Try answering without the use of R; Before submitting, you may use R to see if you can figure out the exercises you werent able to answer; Save your changes to the PDF and submit the result to Brightspace. If you are able to answer most or all of these questions without the use of R, then your level of understanding of R is more than sufficient to follow the course General Research Skills. If you manage to answer 5075% correctly, your skills need some brushing up, but I suspect you will be able to keep up with the pace of the course just fine. If you score poorly, consider joining the R Crash Course. On the first day of the crash course (Tuesday), we will discuss the answers to the self test.
