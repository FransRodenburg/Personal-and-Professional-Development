How should you allocate your time? Can you still spend as much time on sports, hobbies, should you join a student association? What about committees? There are a couple things you should put some thought into to avoid stress from exams, deadlines and studying in general. The most pertinent questions to think about are: How much time do you have? How should allocate your time? 1.1 How Much Time Do You Have? Lets start by putting things into perspective. This is a full-time week of studying (38 hours): Figure 1.1: How a full-time week related to the remaining hours in the week. The scientifically recommended amount of sleep for young adults is 79 hours per day.1 The figure shows 9 hours of sleep so as not to exaggerate the remaining time. With an average 79 hours of sleep and 3840 hours of study, you have at least 65 hours a week left to spend however you see fit. You could get a part-time job, play sports, spend time on your hobbies, go to a student association, spend more time studying, etc. Time spent studying includes lectures, practicals and self-study. Here is what that looked like for a first year biology bachelor student in 20202021: Figure 1.2: Breakdown of the total study time in the first two blocks as a biology bachelor student at Leiden University. Data collected from the schedule of the first 17 weeks of the cohort of 20202021. As you can see, despite its many contact hours, a substantial part of your biology bachelor education consists of self study. This may have been inflated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but even in a normal year, you will spend a large amount of time studying by yourself. That is why you should spend some time thinking about time management: What are you going to do with all that self-study time? Is it enough for you? Can you do with less? What about time spent traveling, can you do some preparation on the train? Or listen to some music and relax for a bit? Try and make conscious decisions about how you spend your day. 1.2 How Should Allocate Your Time? A common misconception is that time management is about spending as much time as possible being productive. Instead, time management is about spending your productive hours as efficiently as possible. The faster you are done with learning, the faster you can unwind and let it all sink in. Sleep, sports, and having fun are every bit as important as the time spent studying. You should respect each of these and allocate enough time to them. The most important parts of time management is meeting deadlines and avoiding stress from deadlines. A very simple rule of thumb for achieving this is by prioritizing your tasks by urgency and importance: Figure 1.3: Variation on the Eisenhower matrix for prioritizing tasks. At some point you will be so familiar with the student life that you may not feel the need for planning your time precisely anymore. Maybe you like wrapping up some work in the evening, or maybe in the weekends. All of this is perfectly fine: Eventually you should do whatever works for you. In the first few weeks though, the key to success is to teach yourself some discipline. Write down a weekly schedule, including how you will spend self study time (reading a chapter of the book, preparing for the practicals, etc.). Not sure what to do on Monday? Start by prioritizing your tasks using figure 1.3. This helps you get a better idea of how much time you actually need, and will lower your stress. Does time management work? A meta analysis of time management research showed that there is at least a moderate effect of time management on job performance, academic achievement and particularly well-being.2 This is more or less in line with the conclusions from an earlier systematic review on time management.3 These arent just two small scale studies: Both of these studies are reviews of a large number of original research articles. So while you may not achieve a full grade point higher, there is substantial scientific evidence suggesting you will have a better time here at Leiden University if you try to apply some form of time management. Assignment 1 You can find more information on how to effectively manage your time over at the E-learning Skills Platform. A template for a weekly schedule is included in step 2. You can use this as a starting point. Write a schedule for next week: It should include all study time (self study or otherwise); Try to include non-studying activities as well (e.g. sports, travel time, time spent at a student association); For every self-study moment in the schedule, describe in a few words how you will use that time; Look ahead at the upcoming exam. Perhaps you can read a chapter of a book, or make a summary of the lectures thusfar. 1.3 Further Reading (*) The Science of Time Management: A blog post explaining time management by comparing human concentration to how a computer schedules its tasks. The Eisenhower Matrix: A blog post elaborating on the classification of tasks based on urgency and importance.

Skills developed in this chapter: Career orientation, professional identity You have chosen a to pursue a bachelor degree in biology. What are the direct options after your education? Should you pursue a master degree? Which one? When should you start thinking about this? These are questions I imagine many of you have. 2.1 When Should I Choose What? For a quick overview, have a look at this flowchart (PDF). A bachelor of science is also your entrance ticket to a master program. In The Netherlands, a large majority of students that obtain a bachelor degree go on to pursue a master degree. According to the national student survey, 91% of biology students at Leiden University go on to pursue a master degree. 2.2 What Is a Minor? In the third year of your bachelor education, the first half of the year (30 ECTS) is spent on a minor education. You can use this to learn more about a specific topic in biology, or to broaden your knowledge by choosing a minor from a different institute. The list of minor educations you can choose from changes from year to year, but rest assured: There are many minors that you can follow in the context of your biology major. As of writing, there are 56 minors offered by Leiden University, and it is also possible to follow a minor at TU Delft or the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. By the time you have to choose a minor, you will be informed of which are eligible for your bachelor education. A minor can be a great opportunity to specialize in a specific area of biology, or to learn about a related field. 2.3 Where Can I Do an Internship? In the third year of your education, after you complete your minor, you will do an internship You often hear the word networking. It is through your network that you can find interesting opportunities, like an internship position. What is networking then? The moment you enter the university, your networking has begun. Every person you come into contact with is an opportunity for you to get to know their work or research. Never hesitate to ask your professor or any of the assistants about their researchthey are probably happy to talk about it. Also always by on the lookout for internship markets. There are plenty of research groups looking for an intern. 2.4 Which Masters Can I Do? To choose your master, always try to join the masters day/week. At this event, all master educations can provide you with information on their contents and admission requirements. It is never too soon to orient, so try to join whenever you can. The IBL offers several master programs to students with a bachelor degree in biology. These include: From Cells To Organisms Evolutionary Biology Molecular Genetics &amp; Biotechnology Biodiversity and Sustainability Biology and Education Biology and Science Communication and Society Biology and Business Studies Although it well be extra challenging due to differences in bachelor courses, you can also follow a master program from other institutes, some examples include: Biomedical Sciences; Biopharmaceutical Science; Life Science &amp; Technology; Statistics &amp; Data Science; Masters from the Institute of Environmental Sciences; Masters from other universities. Assignment 2 Write in 400500 words where you see yourself 510 years from now. You can use the following questions as reference: Why did you choose this education? Are there any subjects you are good at, or enjoy learning about? Do you have any plans for a minor, or master education yet? Where would you like to do an internship and why? Do you currently aspire a career in academia, or elsewhere? How do you currently balance work and life? How do you feel about that? 2.5 In Case You Want To Switch (*) Switching to another bachelor program is a big decision. You should always discuss this with the student coordinator.1 With that said, here are somethings to consider: Successfully completing your first year gets you a certificate (propedeuse), so another suitable moment is after the first year; Successfully completing a bachelor degree in science opens many doors. You may not have to switch at all; Skills learned in one education may transfer well to another, and occasionally you can even get exemption from certain courses that are similar to what you followed.

"],["scientific-writing.html", "Chapter 3 Scientific Writing", " Chapter 3 Scientific Writing Skills developed in this chapter: Personal development Certain aspects of scientific writing you have surely heard before: Start broad, explain the context, get progressively more specific, and finally end broad again, explaining the biological relevance of your findings (fig. 3.1). But how do you write more compelling sentences? and what does actual the scientific publication process look like? Figure 3.1: The hourglass model of scientific writing. Note that some journals require the methods section to be placed at the end of the article. Nevertheless, the style in which each section should be written is the same as shown here. The methods and results sections are the easiest to write. You literally just write down what you have done, and what you have observed as a result of doing so. The aim here is to be clear and objective. The only difficulty is getting used to the style of language in scientific articles, but after reading just several scientific articles within the field of research you are writing about, you should already get the hang of it. The hard parts are the introduction and the discussion. In both of these sections, you have to place your original research into a larger context: The introduction explains why the topic you chose is relevant and summarizes related work. The discussion goes beyond the results, explaining not only how to interpret them, but also what relevance they have for the field as a whole. You may have noticed that the abstract is nowhere to be found in this hourglass model. That is because all the abstract is, is a summary of the article itself. You should write this section last, and it should cover all parts concisely. The conclusion is also not mentioned in figure 3.1. This is because it is simply part of the discussion, along with the limitations and angles for future research. Contents Contents: What did you study? Why did you study it? How did you study it? What did you observe? What do you conclude? Optimize readability, not sentence length It is easy to wave off any difficult sentence as being simply too long. However, as the most highly cited article on scientific writing points out, sentence length itself is not what makes a sentence hard to read.4 To quote the authors: When is a sentence too long? The creators of readability formulas would have us believe there exists some fixed number of words (the favorite is 29) past which a sentence is too hard to read. We disagree. We have seen 10-word sentences that are virtually impenetrable and [] 100-word sentences that flow effortlessly to their points of resolution. References "],["scientific-presentations.html", "Chapter 4 Scientific Presentations 4.1 The Hourglass 4.2 Use of Color", " Chapter 4 Scientific Presentations Skills developed in this chapter: Personal development Im sure youve all heard the following: Minimize slide content; Use figures over words. This is a good starting point, but it hardly conveys how to make an excellent scientific presentation. The problem with recommendations like this is that this is advice about making slides, not presentations. 4.1 The Hourglass So youre going to present about a subject you carefully picked and did a lot of research for. Why would anyone else care? Convince your audience! Do not introduce your topic hastily, but explain why it is relevant. Is there any societal benefit to this research? Your presentation should start by explaining the broader context of your subject. 4.2 Use of Color Certain colors are easier to distinguish between than others. Which of these is better? Ask any of your colorblind friends: Rather than reinventing the wheel, I strongly recommend choosing a color scheme with a tool like ColorBrewer. This ensures maximal separability, while allowing you to choose from a set of colors with certain properties, like being colorblind-friendly, or being suitable for printing. Especially red-green colorblindness is common, occurring in about 8% of men and 0.4% of women.5 So if you do insist on choosing your own colors, at least avoid combinations of red and green.
