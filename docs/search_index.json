[["self-test-r-programming-skill.html", "Chapter 7 Self-Test R Programming Skill Assignment 7", " Chapter 7 Self-Test R Programming Skill Basic programming skills are very important to increase your chances of getting the job of your liking. If you can comfortably run simple analyses and write scripts, you have a strong advantage over other candidates. Just before your internship you will have a course called General Research Skills. In this course, you will be prepared for your internship by teaching you how to effectively search literature, keep your lab journal, and for the largest part: Statistics. Many students find statistics to be a difficult subject. After all, within one course you have to brush up your programming skills, basic mathematics and learn the actual statistics. We have therefore decided to offer students a self-test of their R programming skill. To pass this assignment, all you have to do is do the test and submit it. It does not matter if you pass or not. However, to accommodate students that find programming difficult, we offer a one-week crash course in R, the week before General Research Skills (for 20212022 students, the crash course starts on January 31st). You can find the course here. Assignment 7 Download the test here; Open the test in Adobe Reader; Try answering without the use of R; Before submitting, you may use R to see if you can figure out the exercises you werent able to answer; Save your changes to the PDF and submit the result to Brightspace. If you are able to answer most or all of these questions without the use of R, then your level of understanding of R is more than sufficient to follow the course General Research Skills. If you manage to answer 5075% correctly, your skills need some brushing up, but I suspect you will be able to keep up with the pace of the course just fine. If you score poorly, consider joining the R Crash Course. On the first day of the crash course (Tuesday), we will discuss the answers to the self test. Note: A link to the crash course will be added later, it is currently being developed. Upload your filled in PDF to Brightspace. Please rename the file to lastname_studentnumber.pdf.
